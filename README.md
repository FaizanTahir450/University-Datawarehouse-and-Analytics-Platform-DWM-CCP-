# University-Datawarehouse-and-Analytics-Platform-DWM-CCP-
This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a comprehensive University
Data Warehouse (DWH) and Analytics Platform. The primary objective is to consolidate
disparate institutional data sources—including MySQL, MongoDB, and CSV files—into a central
ized repository to support and enhance data-driven decision-making.
The system architecture is built on a star schema, optimized for analytical querying. A
custom Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline was developed to manage
data extraction, cleansing, validation, and loading. Key features include advanced predictive
analytics using machine learning, such as K-Means clustering for student segmentation, Random
Forest models for student success prediction, and Isolation Forest for financial anomaly detection.
The platform’s business intelligence component, delivered via interactive Plotly Dash dash
boards, provides actionable insights across academic, financial, and human resource domains. This
report details the technical implementation, data quality strategies, business impact, and future
enhancements, demonstrating the system’s value in transforming raw data into actionable intelli
gence.
